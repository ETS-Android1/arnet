Augmented Image Tutorial
=========================
This project is (almost) entirely based on Sceneform's [augmented image](github.com/google-ar/sceneform-android-sdk/tree/master/samples/augmentedimage) sample project, with some minor changes.
Its purpose is to demonstrate the "augmented images" API.

## Prerequisites
1. Android Studio
2. An ARCore [supported device](//developers.google.com/ar/discover/supported-devices)

## Building and Deploying
1. After cloning project, import into Android Studio.
2. Use Gradle to build the project (this should happen automatically).

## Usage
1. Display "app/src/main/assets/kiwi-dark.jpg" on screen and enlarge it.
2. Connect the device (ensure it is recognized in Android Studio).
3. Launch the program... Select: Run 'app'
4. Fit the kiwi bird in the frame.  Once detected, 3D picture frame borders will appear.
..* Note: there is also a giant 3D kiwi bird displayed above (TODO: miniaturize the 3D model)
